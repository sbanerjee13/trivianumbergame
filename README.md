# trivianumbergame
A little trivia number game where the user inputs two numbers and the computer asks math problems based on them. Get a problem right, and you gain a point. Get it wrong, and you lose a point. Make sure that your points stay above 0!
This algorithm/program was made simply to help me improve my understanding of public static objects, classes, methods, and the switch/case/default function.
